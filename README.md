# SubWars

SubWars is a local multiplayer submarine combat game that works like a Jackbox game:

- **TV host** renders the top-down ocean arena and enforces game rules.
- **Phone controllers** let each player steer, dive, ping sonar, and fire torpedoes.

This repository will contain both the server (TV) and client (phone) code.

## How to play (prototype)

1. Clone the repo and run the server (or open `subwars.html` for the single-file WebRTC version).
2. On your TV/laptop, open the host page.
3. On each phone, open the client page, join the room, and rotate landscape.
4. Start the match and enjoy!
